# This is a sample configuration for setting up a webhook with multiple authentication options.
# The available authentication types include apikey_config, totp_config, and cidaas_auth_config.

# When the auth_type is set to "APIKEY", the apikey_config is required, while totp_config and cidaas_auth_config are optional.
# These optional configurations can be removed if not needed. However, by including them, you can easily switch the auth_type 
# to other options by simply updating the auth_type value without needing to modify other parts of the configuration.
