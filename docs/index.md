# CIDAAS Provider
The Terraform provider for Cidaas enables interaction with Cidaas instances that allows to perform CRUD operations on applications, custom providers, registration fields and many other functionalities.

From managing applications to configuring custom providers, the Terraform provider enhances the user's capacity to define, provision and manipulate their Cidaas resources.

## Example Usage

Below is a step-by-step guide to help you set up the provider, configure essential environment variables and integrate the provider into your configuration:

### 1. Terraform Provider Declaration

Begin by specifying the Cidaas provider in your `terraform` block in your Terraform configuration file:

```hcl
terraform {
    required_providers {
      cidaas = {
        version = "3.0.0"
        source  = "Cidaas/cidaas"
      }
    }
}
```

Terraform pulls the version configured of the Cidaas provider for your infrastructure.

### 2. Setup Environment Variables

To authenticate and authorize Terraform operations with Cidaas, set the necessary environment variables. These variables include your Cidaas client credentials, allowing the Terraform provider to complete the client credentials flow and generate an access_token. Execute the following commands in your terminal, replacing placeholders with your actual Cidaas client ID and client secret.

### For Linux and MacOS:
```bash
export TERRAFORM_PROVIDER_CIDAAS_CLIENT_ID="ENTER CIDAAS CLIENT ID"
export TERRAFORM_PROVIDER_CIDAAS_CLIENT_SECRET="ENTER CIDAAS CLIENT SECRET"
```

### For Windows:
```bash
Set-Item -Path env:TERRAFORM_PROVIDER_CIDAAS_CLIENT_ID -Value “ENTER CIDAAS CLIENT ID“
Set-Item -Path env:TERRAFORM_PROVIDER_CIDAAS_CLIENT_SECRET -Value “ENTER CIDAAS CLIENT SECRET“
```

You can get a set of client credentials from the Cidaas Admin UI by creating a new client. Simply go to the `Apps` > `App Settings` > `Create New App`. It's important to note that when creating the client, you must select the app type as **Non-Interactive**.

### 3. Add Cidaas Provider Configuration

Next, add the Cidaas provider configuration to your Terraform configuration file. Specify the `base_url` parameter to point to your Cidaas instance. For reference, check the example folder.

```hcl
provider "cidaas" {
  base_url = "https://terraform-cidaas-test-free.cidaas.de"
}
```

**Note:** Starting from version 2.5.1, the `redirect_url` is no longer supported in the provider configuration. Ensure that you adjust your configuration accordingly.

By following these steps, you integrate the Cidaas Terraform provider, enabling you to manage your Cidaas resources with Terraform.
