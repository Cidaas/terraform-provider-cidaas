```terraform
# cidaas_consent_version sample for consent_type "SCOPES"
resource "cidaas_consent_version" "v1" {
  version         = 1
  consent_id      = cidaas_consent.sample.id
  consent_type    = "SCOPES"

- `version` (Number) The version number of the consent. It can not be updated for a specific consent version.

### Optional

- `consent_type` (String) Specifies the type of consent. The allowed values are `SCOPES` or `URL`. It can not be updated for a specific consent version.
- `required_fields` (Set of String) A set of fields that are required for the consent. It can not be updated for a specific consent version.

- `scopes` (Set of String) A set of scopes related to the consent. It can not be updated for a specific consent version.
Note that the attribute `scopes` is required only if the `consent_type` is set to **SCOPES**.

<a id="nestedatt--consent_locales"></a>
### Nested Schema for `consent_locales`

Required:

## Import

In the import statement, the identifier is the combination of `consent_id`, `consent_version_id` and `locale` joined by the special character ":".
To import a consent version for multiple locales, you need to append the locales separated by ":".
For example, the identifier "3f453233-92d4-475b-b10e:813fbd47-6c50-4fc4-881a:en-us:de:en" imports the consent version for the locales `en-us`, `de` and `en`.

Below is an exmaple of import command to import a consent version:

```shell
terraform import cidaas_consent_version.v1 3f453233-92d4-475b-b10e:813fbd47-6c50-4fc4-881a:en-us
```
