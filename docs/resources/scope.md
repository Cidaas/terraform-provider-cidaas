# cidaas_scope (Resource)

### V2 to V3 Migration:
If you are migrating from v2 to v3, please note the following changes in the v3 version:

- The `locale`, `language`, `title` and `description` attributes have been removed and replaced with a `localized_descriptions` block that supports a scope with multiple locale with better internationalization. Earlier only one locale was supported by the terraform plugin.
- `localized_descriptions` is a list of objects, each containing:
  - locale
  - title
  - description
- The `language` attribute is no longer required. The provider computes and assigns the language based on the `locale` provided.

## old configuration:
```terraform
resource "scope" "sample" {
  locale                = "en-US"
  language              = "en-US"
  title                 = "terraform title"
  description           = "terraform description"
  security_level        = "PUBLIC"
  scope_key             = "terraform-test-scope"
  required_user_consent = false
  group_name            = []
}
```

## Example Usage(V3 configuration)

```terraform
resource "cidaas_scope" "sample" {
  security_level        = "CONFIDENTIAL"
  scope_key             = "terraform-sample-scope"
  required_user_consent = false
  group_name            = []
  localized_descriptions = [
    {
      title       = "Cidaas Scope Tunisia Title"
      locale      = "ar-TN"
      description = "This is scope in local ar-TN"
    },
    {
      title       = "Cidaas Scope German Title"
      locale      = "de-DE"
      description = "This is scope in local de-DE"
    },
    {
      title       = "Cidaas Scope India Title"
      locale      = "en-IN"
      description = "This is scope in local en-IN"
    }
  ]
}
```
