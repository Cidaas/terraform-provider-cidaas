# cidaas_webhook (Resource)

The Webhook resource in the provider facilitates integration of webhooks in the cidaas system. This resource allows you to configure webhooks with different authentication options.

 Ensure that the below scopes are assigned to the client with the specified `client_id`:

* cidaas:webhook_read
* cidaas:webhook_write
* cidaas:webhook_delete

## Example Usage

```terraform
# This is a sample configuration for setting up a webhook with multiple authentication options.
# The available authentication types include apikey_config, totp_config, and cidaas_auth_config.

# When the auth_type is set to "APIKEY", the apikey_config is required, while totp_config and cidaas_auth_config are optional.
# These optional configurations can be removed if not needed. However, by including them, you can easily switch the auth_type 
# to other options by simply updating the auth_type value without needing to modify other parts of the configuration.

resource "cidaas_webhook" "sample_webhook" {
  auth_type = "APIKEY"
  url       = "https://cidaas.de/webhook-srv/webhook"
  events = [
    "ACCOUNT_MODIFIED"
  ]
  apikey_config = {
    key         = "api-key"
    placeholder = "test-apikey-placeholder"
    placement   = "query"
  }
  totp_config = {
    key         = "totp-key"
    placeholder = "test-totp-placeholder"
    placement   = "query"
  }
  cidaas_auth_config = {
    client_id = "ce90d6ba-9a5a-49b6-9a50-b8db759e9b90"
  }
}
```
