### V2 to V3 Migration:
If you are migrating from v2 to v3, please note the changes in the format of the import identifier:

- In **v2**, the import identifier was formed by joining template_key, template_type and locale with the character `-`. For example: `TERRAFORM_TEMPLATE-SMS-en-us`.

- In **v3**, the import identifier format has been updated. The character `-` is replaced by the character `:`. For example: `TERRAFORM_TEMPLATE:SMS:en-us`.


### Managing System Templates:

- To create system templates, set the **is_system_template** flag to `true`.
By default, this value is `false` and creates custom templates when applied.
- When creating system templates validation checks are applied and suggestions are
provided in error messages to assist users in creating system templates.
- System templates cannot be imported using the standard Terraform import command. Instead, users
must create a configuration that matches the existing system template and run terraform apply.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/resources/cidaas_template/resource.tf" }}

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# System templates cannot be imported using the standard Terraform import command.
# Instead, users must create a configuration that matches the existing system template and run terraform apply.

# V3 Change Note: The format of the import identifier is changed in V3. In V2, the import identifier was joined by the chracter "-"
# However in V3, it is replaced by the chracter ":". Example: TERRAFORM_TEMPLATE:SMS:en-us 

# Below is the command to import a custom template
# Here, template_key:template_type:locale is a combination of template_key, template_type and locale, joined by the special character ":".
# For example, if the resource name is "sample" with template_key as "TERRAFORM_TEMPLATE", template_type as "SMS" and locale as "de-de", the import statement would be:

terraform import cidaas_template.sample TERRAFORM_TEMPLATE:SMS:de-de
```
